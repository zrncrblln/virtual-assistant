# Deployment to GitHub Pages TODO

- [ ] Modify vite.config.ts to set build.outDir to 'docs'
- [ ] Update .gitignore to exclude 'docs' instead of 'dist'
- [ ] Run npm run build to generate the production build in docs/
- [ ] Commit the changes (including the docs/ folder) and push to the main branch
- [ ] Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings for main branch /docs (manual step on GitHub)
